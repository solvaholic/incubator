# Solvaholic's Incubator
A friendly mama duck for developing ideas

# Workflow
1. Create a branch to work in
2. Push a new .md file to the branch, based on `idea_template.md`
3. Create a Pull Request for the branch, with this checklist:
    ```
    - [ ] What is the problem?
    - [ ] Who has this problem?
    - [ ] What solutions exist?
    - [ ] What will we do about it?
    ```
4. Mention and link to the idea in `new_ideas.md`
5. Fill out the idea's .md file and update the checklist
6. Merge the Pull Request, consider giving the idea its own project
7. Move the idea from `new_ideas.md` to `index.md`
