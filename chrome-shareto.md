## What is the problem?
In Android many apps have a Share button that lets you share links or content with other apps.

For example, when you find an interesting how-to you'd like to use with a project you can easily create a card in Trello for it :

Browser -> Share -> Trello -> Select board and list, tap Create

That share button is not available in Chrome on macOS, and we miss it.

## Who has this problem?
Probably just me, and maybe some people who'd rather AddTo not use their browsing activity to print money.

## What solutions exist?
macOS has a Share Menu extension that's available in Safari and Opera but not Chrome :

A solution is written and mostly through code review, tho inactive since May 2015 :

## What will we do about it?
How will we solve this problem? (How) Will our solution be better?
